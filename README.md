# Mirkwood :wood:

> “There is always more about you than anyone expects!” - Gandalf

Mirkwood is an educational maze-solving game, with the intention to teach kids programming logic.

The name is thematically inspired by `Thy Hobbit`, which is a book my kids loved when we read together, and specifically a homage to the spiders in the Mirkwood forest.
It fits the theme since Gandalf (and Beorn) advises Thorin's company not to stray from the path

## Status: In-Development :construction:

This is still an in-development project and as soon as it is playable this will be updated.

## Structure

This is a TUI project (no one should be afraid of the terminal) that aims to read inputs and follow them to solve mazes.
Those inputs will be encoded as a series of commands, which then build an algorithm that must be successfully executed to reach the end of the maze.
The initial levels can be solved by simply describing the paths one must walk to get to the end, but as the levels progress more complexities are included:
- Decision making/branching;
- Marks on the path;
- Subroutines;
- Limits to command input;
- Loops;
- etc.

All of those will be progressively introduced to build knowledge on top of knowledge based on both theory and practical experience, creating a solid foundation for problem solving and programming.
